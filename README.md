 Introduction

This is a code repository for the corresponding app.

Here, we will create a PWA. We're going to use React with service workers.

By the end of this, you will have a strong understanding of what PWA is and how you can build, deploy and publish it.

Setup:

    run npm i && npm start for both client and server side to start the development server
